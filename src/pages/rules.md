1. **Hateful conduct**

    We do not permit any form of bigotry or hateful ideology, including but not limited to: fascism/nazism, racism, misogyny, homo/trans/queerphobia, antisemitism, ableism, as well as threats against marginalised communities or the “debate” of theirs right to a safe existence.

2. **Harassment**

    We do not permit harassment, including but not limited to: insults, bullying, dogpiling/brigading, bad faith trolling (“sealioning”), or boundary violations (for instance non-consensual flirting or unsolicited nudes). Requests to terminate conversations are to be respected.

3. **Safeguarding**

    We do not permit content that endangers others, such as others’ personal or identifiable information (“doxxing”) or the sharing of private conversations without consent. Promoting or encouraging self-harm or suicide will not be permitted.

4. **Sexual Content**

    Sexual content, such as erotic nudity or pornography, may be shared behind a content warning. Sexual content may not be shared on public timelines.

5. **CSAM/Abuse**

    Sexualised depictions of children, real (“child porn”, child sexual abuse material) or fictional (“lolicon”, “shotacon”), as well as sexual content shared without consent (reposting, “revenge porn”), are not permitted and will be removed.

6. **Misinformation**

    We do not permit the promotion of misinformation and conspiracy theories. Impersonating persons or organisations is not permitted, with the exception of parody.

7. **Spam**

    We do not permit spam, including but not limited to: excessive automated/identical posting, unsolicited off-topic replies, corporate advertisement, excessive/unsolicited promotion, crossposting on the public timelines. Bot accounts are not permitted unless administrators’ exceptional approval.

8. **Illegal content**

    This instance is hosted in France and subject to French law. As such, any content illegal in France may be removed without prior warning.

9. **Be nice**

    Mutual respect and kindness are strongly encouraged. Unprompted aggression may be dealt with as needed on a case-by-case basis. For the same reason, content warnings for common triggers are heavily encouraged, and may be required at the team’s discretion.

The administration and moderation team reserve the right to remove content and discipline accounts at their discretion for reasons not or not yet listed in these rules. Attempts to find loopholes permitting harassment, such as wording bigotry politely, will not be tolerated and dealt with in best judgement.
